"""Submit-time dedup for graph maintenance must also treat a *running* job as
covering the bank.

`run_graph_maintenance_job` states that it relies on submit-time dedup to keep
at most one job per bank running, and skips SKIP LOCKED on that basis. That was
not true: dedup matched only `status = 'pending'`, and a pending row is claimed
within milliseconds under load. Each subsequent trigger therefore found no
pending row and inserted another job, so a bank taking sustained writes
accumulated one maintenance job per write — hundreds of concurrent jobs
against a single bank, all doing the same bank-wide sweeps.

Consolidation must keep the old behaviour: its job fixes a watermark when it
starts, so content added afterwards genuinely needs a fresh run. Graph
maintenance drains its own queue to empty instead, which is what makes matching
`processing` safe there and not there.

These run against the real Postgres test DB — the dedup is a SQL predicate over
`async_operations`, so a mock would prove nothing about it.
